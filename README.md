# tetris-theme-raspberry-pi-pico
MicroPython code for playing the Tetris theme on the Raspberry Pi Pico H
You'll need to install MicroPython on your device, and I used Thonny to code on the Pico.
The kit I used was: Raspberry Pi Pico H, a buzzer with 2 male-male jumper wires, and a micro USB cable.
